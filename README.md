# SINO

SINO is a full-stack MERN web app I am building as a theoretical test site for a company I am working at. It will be used to display information about the company along with a User Portal for medical and nursing students with useful features.

#### Stack:
* Front-End: Uses React.js for UI along with Redux for state management.
* Back-End: Uses a Node.js server with Express coupled with a MongoDB database.

#### Student Features:
* Track important deadlines and events
* Get information for residency applications
* Interact with real doctors and preceptors
* Communicate with eachother through a student forum
